    <h2>Product Strategy</h2>
    
    <section id="wood-types">
        <h3>Wood Type Evaluation</h3>
        
        <p>Selecting the right wood types for CNC machining in Calgary's climate is crucial for producing high-quality, durable products. This evaluation considers the characteristics of various wood types, their machining properties, durability, and suitability for Calgary's unique climate conditions.</p>
        
        <h4>Hardwood vs. Softwood</h4>
        <p>Wood for CNC machining is primarily divided into hardwood and softwood categories. Each type has its own advantages and best use cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardwoods:</strong> Preferred for their durability and ability to handle complex carvings. Examples include Ash, Cherry, Walnut, and Maple.</li>
            <li><strong>Softwoods:</strong> Used where weather resistance is required or for more cost-effective solutions. Examples include Cedar and Cypress.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Machining Characteristics</h4>
        <h5>Hardwoods:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ash:</strong> Known for shock resistance, ideal for sports equipment and furniture.</li>
            <li><strong>Walnut:</strong> Valued for its aesthetic appeal and ease of machining, suitable for fine furniture and intricate designs.</li>
            <li><strong>Cherry:</strong> Ideal for carving and turning due to its smooth grain, used in musical instruments and furniture.</li>
            <li><strong>Maple:</strong> Hard and durable, preferred for sturdy, lasting furniture pieces.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Softwoods:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cedar:</strong> Naturally weather-resistant, used in outdoor projects despite challenges with knots.</li>
            <li><strong>Cypress:</strong> Decay-resistant, used in external applications like windows and panels.</li>
            <li><strong>Fir:</strong> Offers durability similar to hardwoods, used for furniture and flooring.</li>
            <li><strong>Spruce:</strong> Lightweight and economical, used for decay-resistant furniture.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Durability Assessment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardwoods:</strong> Generally more durable due to their density and tight grain patterns, making them ideal for high-quality, long-lasting projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Softwoods:</strong> Provide sufficient durability for various indoor and some outdoor applications, with the advantage of being more cost-effective than hardwoods.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Climate Considerations for Calgary</h4>
        <p>Calgary's climate, characterized by cold winters and varied humidity levels, can significantly affect wood performance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardwoods:</strong> Due to their density, they are less prone to expand and contract with changing humidity levels, making them suitable for stable, indoor applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Softwoods:</strong> Being more flexible, they might cope better with temperature fluctuations in outdoor uses if properly treated.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Recommendations</h4>
        <p>For CNC machining in Calgary, we recommend:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prioritize hardwoods like Maple and Walnut for high-end, durable indoor furniture and decor items.</li>
            <li>Use Cedar or treated Cypress for outdoor projects that require weather resistance.</li>
            <li>Consider Cherry for intricate, decorative pieces where a smooth finish is crucial.</li>
            <li>Utilize Ash for products that require shock resistance, such as tool handles or sporting goods.</li>
            <li>Incorporate Fir or Spruce for more economical indoor furniture options.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>By carefully selecting wood types based on these considerations, we can ensure that our CNC wood-crafted products are not only beautiful and functional but also well-suited to Calgary's unique climate conditions, providing long-lasting value to our customers.</p>
