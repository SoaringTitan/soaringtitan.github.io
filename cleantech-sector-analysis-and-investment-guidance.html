    <h3>Historical Valuation Trends</h3>
    <p>Cleantech valuations have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years. By the last quarter of 2024, the median EV/Revenue multiple for cleantech companies was 1.8x, almost double the pre-pandemic levels despite recent downward adjustments. The green energy sector has shown even higher multiples, with a median EV/Revenue multiple reaching approximately 5.0x in late 2023.</p>
    
    <h3>Valuation Methods and Metrics</h3>
    <p>Several methods are commonly used to value pre-seed cleantech startups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparable Company Analysis (CCA):</strong> Compares the startup to similar companies in terms of industry, stage, and size.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-to-Duplicate Approach:</strong> Estimates the cost to replicate the startup from scratch.</li>
        <li><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):</strong> Calculates the present value of expected future cash flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Scorecard Method:</strong> Adjusts average pre-money valuations based on factors like team, market size, product, and competition.</li>
        <li><strong>Venture Capital Method:</strong> Estimates the anticipated exit value and discounts it back to present value.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Key Valuation Drivers</h3>
    <p>The valuation of cleantech startups at the pre-seed stage is primarily driven by:</p>
    <ul>
